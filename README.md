## Portinari v2.0

Portinari is a tool that allows medical researchers to mine patterns of risk in *Entity-Event* data-sets. It was originally thought of for the context of cervical cancer screening, but its concepts can be adapted to any sort of data-set that contains information both about an *Entity* and about *Events* that this entity experience.
